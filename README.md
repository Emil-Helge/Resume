# My personal resume

I have updated my resume to bettet represent myself and what I have to offer.

In addition to the information about myself, I have carefully styled the page to be both responsive and with a rather minimalistic and clean design with a touch of **Javascript** to create flow and interactivity.


I have created a demo link [HERE.](https://resume-emil-helge.netlify.app/) Feel free to check it out!
